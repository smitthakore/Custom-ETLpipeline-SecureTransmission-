*Steganography*
Image Steganography is the technique of hiding data(including text, image, audio, video) inside an image in such a way that a human being generally wonâ€™t be able to distinguish between the manipulated image and the original image. This adds an extra layer of security to the data being transmitted.
Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is the ratio between the maximum possible power of an image and the power of corrupting noise that affects the quality of its representation. To estimate the PSNR of an image, it is necessary to compare that image to an ideal clean image with the maximum possible power.
PSNR is most commonly used to estimate the efficiency of compressors, filters, etc. The larger the value of PSNR, the more efficient is a corresponding compression or filter method.
